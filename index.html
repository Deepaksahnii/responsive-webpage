                helped the nation to achieve development. Indian education system is fascinating and it has gradually
                reached the present status with several other contributions. The history of education in India is
                equally enthralling. Historical Background of Indian Education includes the involvement of Vedas,
                Puranas, Ayurveda, Yoga, Kautilya's Arthasahtra which has significantly contributed to the development
                of Education in Modern India. The present education system in India is also influenced by the spread of
                different religions such as Buddhism and Jainism as well as Bhakti and Sufi movements.</p>

            <p class="secSubTag text-small">Education in modern India gained a whole new facet with the promotion of
                western education in India, which almost inevitably started with the coming of the British. The British
                employed the strategy of emotional and intellectual colonisation in India, to consolidate the political
                immigration. It was the affinity of the elite section of Indian society to English culture, ideology and
                education, which facilitated the British to psychologically harness the nation's outward mindset. The
                British wanted the malleable Indians to learn, speak and believe English and become shadows of
                Englishmen.</p>

            <p class="secSubTag text-small">In the Charter of 1833, English was announced to be the official language in
                India. The advent of English education in British India was thus a reformation movement of the 19th
                century which provided opportunity for the women and people belonging to the lower castes for education.
                Thus, the British is credited for bringing a revolution in the Indian education system. The colonial
                period, from 1757 to 1947, were the period for the uprising for various scholars and reformists. The
                introduction of institutions, for Western education based learning, was introduced by the beginning of
                the early nineteenth century. Thus the education system involved the British curriculum and English as
                the medium of instruction</p>
